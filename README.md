I'm a **Fullstack Developer**, experienced on *Python, PHP and Typescript*, and frameworks like *Django, Laravel, Express and Flask*. In this days I'm forming me on *React.JS, React Native*, **Kotlin for native android development** and *Elixir*.

At this moment I have aprox 1 year and a half like professional developer, everyday I try to learn new things and good practices to start projects focused on the logic and not on the laguange to use.

Feel free to send me a mail if you interested on my jobs and the things that I can do. See you! ü§ù
